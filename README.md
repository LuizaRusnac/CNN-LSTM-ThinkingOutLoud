# Imaginary Speech Recognition Using a Convolutional Network with Long-Short Memory

This repository contains code for of the Convolutional Network with Long-Short Memory (CNN-LSTM) model using EEG signals for imaginary speech recognition. The code accompanies the paper titled [Imaginary Speech Recognition Using a Convolutional Network with Long-Short Memory](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/22/11873), authored by Ana-Luiza Rusnac, Ovidiu Grigore.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to recognize speech from imaginary utterances, enabling a new method of communication for individuals who are unable to speak vocally. The proposed model utilizes a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to capture spatial and temporal features from the input data.
