# CNN architectures and feature extraction methods for EEG imaginary speech recognition

**Abstract: Speech is a complex mechanism allowing us to communicate our needs, desires and 9
thoughts. In some cases of neural disfunctions this ability is highly affected which makes everyday 10
life activities that needs communication a challenge. This paper aims to study different parameters 11
of an intelligent imaginary speech recognition system to obtain the best performance according to 12
the developed method. For developing the system, we used signals from the Kara One database 13
containing recordings acquired for seven phonemes and four words. In our study we included a 14
comparison of two approaches designed in the feature extraction stage based on computing the 15
cross-covariance matrix in time and frequency domain. Further, we observed the system perfor- 16
mances when using different window length for the input signal. Another study included in the 17
paper is based on comparison of different architectures of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 18
in order to observe the evolution of the system starting from simpler architectures and increasing 19
the complexity. Our study was conducted on eight different subjects and is meant to be a patient- 20
independent generalized system. The best performance reported in this paper is rising up to 37% 21
accuracy for all 11 different phonemes and words when using cross-covariance computed over the 22
signal spectrum of a 0.5 second window and a CNN containing three convolutional layers with 64, 23
128 and 64 filters connected to a dense layer with 64 neurons.**
