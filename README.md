# Imaginary Speech Recognition Using a Convolutional Network with Long-Short Memory

This repository contains code for various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures and feature extraction methods for EEG imaginary speech recognition. The code accompanies the paper titled [Imaginary Speech Recognition Using a Convolutional Network with Long-Short Memory](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/22/11873), authored by Ana-Luiza Rusnac, Ovidiu Grigore.

## Overview

In this work, we explore different CNN architectures and feature extraction methods for EEG-based imaginary speech recognition. The repository includes implementations of various CNN models and feature extraction techniques, along with scripts for data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.
